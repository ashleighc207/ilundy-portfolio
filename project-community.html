      <p class="project-subtitle">  Less than a month out from the required launch date of MedStar Health’s annual Report to the Community, it was brought to the digital team’s attention that there were tracking and usability issues with the report. The navigation was hidden, an excessive amount of scrolling was required, type was hard to read, and only after delving into the project did we realize there was no way for the community to engage with the site or participate in the programs it promoted. </p>

      <p class="blurb-text">Because there was little budget and time available, we utilized existing styles and common features our developer was already familiar with. To further expedite development digital decided that because only minor updates would be made once live, no CMS would be needed. <br>
        <br>
        To help make the report easier for users to read and navigate; distracting colored backgrounds were removed; large headlines, body copy and images decreased in size; and a three column grid was implemented on the homepage to condense content.</p>

One box was to advertise MedStar Now, a new product launched to help triage patients as effortlessly as possible. The other serves as a clear means of contact for community members interested in our programs.</p>
